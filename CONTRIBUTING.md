# Contributing

Hey! Thanks for being interested in contributing to the ArcTexel! Please read below guide before continuing.

## Overview

ArcTexel consists of a few sub-projects:

- [ColorPicker](https://github.com/ArcTexel/ColorPicker) - UI component for picking colors and gradients.
- [Drawie](https://github.com/ArcTexel/Drawie) - Core rendering library
- [ArcDocks](https://github.com/ArcTexel/ArcDocks) - Docking and layout manager for Avalonia
- [ArcParser](https://github.com/ArcTexel/ArcParser) - Parser for .arc files

Before making any changes to files that are part of above, remember that these are standalone, ArcTexel independed libraries and shouldn't contain code strictly related to ArcTexel codebase.

## Where to start?

ArcTexel codebase is big, it might be a little intimidating to start. Make sure to start with little tasks first and get slowly familiar with it. 
The very first place to look at is [Issues](https://github.com/ArcTexel/ArcTexel/issues), find issues with `good first issue` labels. Each issue should contain a description or comments with tips on what files to look at.

And if you're stuck, don't hesitate to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qSRMYmq). We are more than happy to guide you and help.

It is also a good practice to comment on the issue that you want to work on it, we'll assign the issue to you. Generally, you should take the issues with `up-for-grabs` label, it basically means that core development team doesn't plan to work on them anytime soon. If the issue is assigned
to someone, ask in the comments if the person is actively working on it, and if not you might be assigned.

## **Do not make undiscussed features!**

It is very important to discuss any new features with ArcTexel's development team. This is just to ensure that your work and our time won't be wasted, it is perfectly sufficient to create an issue on GitHub or even ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/qSRMYmq) or [Forum](https://forum.arctexel.net) with brief description of what you want to do.
